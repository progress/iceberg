# oemanager.properties file - Modify as Needed for PAS Instance
#
# Changing the scheme will affect the port
# used when run from within a PAS instance
#
#scheme=[http|https]
#
# By default localhost is assumed for local
# PAS instances, though both the host and port
# may be set to manage a remote PAS instance
#
#host=localhost
#port=
#
# These are best set via the command line
# parameters unless these are static values
# for the intended PAS instance
#
#ablapp=
#webapp=
#
# Modify to match the credentials used for
# both the oemanager and manager webapps.
#
# These should always be secured for production use!

#
# WARNING: These values must be stored in plain text format!
#          Do not leave this file/folder unsecured when in
#          production. As a best-practice, only pass these
#          values via the command line.
