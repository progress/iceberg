# Load Testing #

Providing automated means of exercising the transports for a PAS instance.

----------

## Areas ##

**APSV** - Focuses on use of parallel tasks via Ant to place multiple concurrent client connections for AppServer requests against ABL code in a PAS instance.

**Restful** - Focuses on using RESTful requests via either the REST or Web transports of a PAS instance. This approach relies on 3rd-party tools which are adept at performing these tasks.
